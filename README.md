# Ren

![Logo](window_icon.png)

Ren is framemork(inspired by Ren'Py) for story driven games in Godot.

## Important

I started this project again from scratch beacause:

 1. Wrong desing in previous implentacion
 1. It was hard to write project like this in GDScript

Now I use [Godot 3.0a with beta godot-python](https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python).
It means that now project will be written in Python.

## Story driven games

It means games that are for example:

- Visual Novels (ToDo)
- Click & Point Adventures (ToDo)
- RPG(ToDo)

Logo is now base on Godot icon from Linux Pop icon theme.</p> Logo is Godot head with hair like anime character.
